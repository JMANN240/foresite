		How You're Allowed to Use this Site.
	</h2>
	<p>
		{{site_settings['name']}} is a website that allows you to harness the power of artificial intelligence for the purposes of entertainment. This site is merely a wrapper around some very strong technologies. That being said, if this site is used incorrectly (or not used at all) to access the underlying technologies something could go wrong. This page is just saying that if you go off the path we made for you, we are not responsible for what happens.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Limited Liability
	</h3>
	<p>
		We are not responsible for any consequences due to improper use of the site. As mentioned before, the site is like a path for you to follow. Pages build API calls according to our specification, so if you decide to build your own API call it may not work as expected. This could result in loss of your tokens, loss of your data, or worse. We try to put guardrails along the metaphorical path to stop these bad things from happening, but in the case that you try to hop the guardrails we are not liable.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another aspect of the site that we are not liable for is the unpredictability of artificial intelligence. The podcasts that are generated do not reflect the views of the site itself nor its creators. We are not liable for offensive, harmful, or otherwise malicious content generated by the AI prompted by users.
	</p>
	<p>
		We use an external service for payments. We are not liable for errors in payment processing.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Privacy Policy
	</h3>
	<p>
		Our privacy policy is detailed <a class="underlined" href="/privacy">here</a>. Basically, we'll keep your private data private.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Governing Law
	</h3>
	<p>
		These terms and conditions are governed by the laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of Ohio (ah jeez, Ohio).
